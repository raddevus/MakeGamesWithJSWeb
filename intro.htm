Entire development kit from start to finish on learning GameDev.
This is not a philosophical book about game design.
This is a project-oriented book which starts out with simple & ugly games to show you that you can start at zero and go to amazing levels even if you have no programming training.

We create:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic working framework:  (game dev framework which requires very few resources to get you started)</li>
<li>We'll build a reusable game dev enviroment which will include:</li>
<li>IDE (can be local or remote using https://stackblitz.com/ or local using Visual Studio Code (free) or any text-based editor</li>
<li>HTML basic template where your game will run.  Copy/Paste the template and your project is ready.  But, we will learn about and understand everything that is in the template so you can alter it for your own purposes.</li>
<li>The HTML element where your game runs inside the browser is called the Canvas – you'll learn all about how to set it up</li>
<li>JavaScript - You will learn how to control the game Canvas with JS so you'll learn JavaScript along the way to building your own games.  JavaScript is a great first language but I will provide warnings along the way which will help you create a structured way to develop your games and apps</li>
<li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - Styles will be used to adjust things so they look right.  There won't be a huge focus on CSS because most of our code will run in the Canvas and the Canvas doesn't use CSS.  However, basic sizing of the Canvas can be controlled in CSS and we may use CSS to style some things like scoreboards etc.</li>
<li>Game Assets - I will show you where to get free and low-cost images, sprites (game characters), music etc that you can use in your games.  You may not be an artist (i'm not) but you can leverage the power of other artists to build your game.  This is how it is done in the industry – game devs rely on asset creators to create the game characters that we bring to life.  </li>
Hosting your game on a web site.  Why? Because we want to be able to share our games as soon as we create them.  If you put them on a publicly accessible web site then you can invite your friends (and social media connections) to try out the games you've invented and created.
</ul>
<p>
That's it, the rest of the book is all about how to build games that your friends and social media connections can run right inside their browsers.
