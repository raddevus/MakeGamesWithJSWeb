<p>The best way to learn is to learn the most basic unit of what you are learning
and then once you've mastered that, move on to the next basic unit and learn that skill.
<p>This is a kind of skill-stacking that feels slow (at first) but then builds 
in such a way that helps you so you don't get stuck later and helps you
to not have to go back and re-learn things.</p>
<h3>Methods That Help You Learn</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn the basics. Make sure you understand everything about the foundational items of the thing you are learning.</li>
<li>Learn in small segments and test your knowledge.  This means you should learn a small chunk, then try using that knowledge.</li>
<li>Push to new skills.  Once you learn the underlying concepts, don't get stuck on those, but push to learn the next level skills.</li>
<li>Gain empirical understanding.  Use the skills you learn and gain experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How Do These Apply To Make Games With JS?</h4>
<p>This book breaks everything down into smalls pieces you can learn quickly.
</p>
<p>This book takes the things you learn and uses it to build working apps -- even if they are very basic.</p>
<p>After you learn the concept and examine the code, you should take the code and do something different with it.  Make the code your own.
When you do that you'll own the knowledge.
