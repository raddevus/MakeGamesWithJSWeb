<h1>Two Ways to Learn </h1>

<h2>Background: A Story About Fishing</h2>
<p>When I was thirteen, my mom remarried & we moved from the suburbs to a rural 
area.  There was no cable tv (1981) available and we didn't even have an Atari 2600.
We did haved a pond though.  I knew nothing about fishing. I convinced my mom to buy
me a fishing pole (rod & reel) and I started fishing.  
Our pond had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegill" target="_blank">Bluegill</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrarchidae" target="_blank"> Sunfish</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish" target="_blank">catfish</a>.  At one point I was out there every single day fishing and learning about the pond habit and the creatures that lived in it.
There were also 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bullfrog" target="_blank">bullfrogs </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish">crayfish</a>.
</p>
<p>
During those years I became something of a Naturalist 
(<a href="#heritage-def">"One versed in natural science; a student of natural history, esp. of the natural history of plants or animals; a botanist or zoologist."</a>*)
On my own I studied everything in that pond and the surrounding area. I cleaned the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae" target="_blank">algae</a> growth out to insure a good biosphere for the fish. Algae can inhibit oxygen in the water and cause fish to die.
</p>
<p>
We live in Ohio so the winters were so cold our little pond would freeze over and many of the species around the pond hibernated or migrated away.
</p>
<p>
With nothing to do outside during those long winters, I discovered Fishing Magazines.  I started reading them and learned all manner of information about fish
 and their habitats.  I discovered new species (bass, northern pike, walleye) and discovered that different fish are attracted to different baits & lures.
</p>
<h3>Hands-On Fishing Lead To Book Knowledge</h3>
<p>
I never would've started out just reading about fish.  However, once I did the hands-on fishing, I was motivated to discover more about fish and their habitat and I was ready to read about them.
</p>
<p>
At one point, during one particularly long winter I started clipping pictures of fish out of magazines and assemblying a <strong>Scrapbook of Fish</strong>.
</p>
<p>
I can only imagine the ensuing disaster if someone had forced me to read the Fish Encyclopedia and make this scrapbook before actually fishing.
<br>
If that would've happened I would've probably still hated fish & fishing to this day.
</p>

<h2>How Is Fishing Related To Learning To Make Games?</h2>
<p>Consider how I learned to fish.  I bought a fishing rod and started fishing.  That's it.
</p>
<p>Now imagine if instead I had been told by an instructor, "To learn to fish you must first read the entire 
<strong>Encyclopeida of Fishes</strong>.<br>
"The book is 1,536 pages long but you must have all of this knowledge in order to begin fishing."
It is unlikely I ever would've started fishing.  However, this is often the method that is used to teach people to write computer code.

<h2>Two Main Ways To Learn To Make Games</h2>

There are two main (and different) ways you can learn to make games: 
<ol>
<li>Read a long book that tells you all about the history of games and examines the art of games  and lists 
all the games you can play.</li>
<li>Start building games.  Begin at the beginning and go on from there. </li>
</ol>

Make Games With JS  will use the second method to teach.
This method makes learning faster and here's why. 

<h3>Read Entire Fish Encyclopedia </h3>
<p>The first method is similar to reading the entire Fish Encyclopedia 
 so you can know how to catch a fish.  Sure, there's a lot of information 
in the encyclopedia that may be helpful, but perhaps you first want to 
decide if you even like fishing. </p>

<h3>Start Fishing </h3>
The second method gets you fishing so you can feel what it's like to collect bait, put the bait on a hook, cast your line, wait, not catch a fish, and finally (hopefully) catch a fish. 

<h3>There Are Things You Won't Know </h3>
Using the second method, there are a lot of things that you won't know as you fish.  But, those things only matter if you decide to continue fishing.   
So, as long as you feel comfortable not knowing some things at first, you will like the way this book teaches electronics.
 
<h3>Try It, Learn It </h3>
In this book we try it and then we learn it.  We build it first and see it work and then we figure out how it works and why it behaves the way it does.
 
<h3>Which Is More Memorable? </h3>
<p>
The try it learn it method is more fun and ends up being more memorable too.  <br>
Which do you think you'll remember more: 
<ul>
<li>Reading the Encyclopedia of Fish </li>
<li>Going on a fishing trip. </li>
</ul>

Right.  Going on the fishing trip is a whole lot more fun, a better way to learn and more memorable.
