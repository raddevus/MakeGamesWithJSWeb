	<p> There's a great new example which includes scoring, high scores & sounds.</p>
	<p> Check out chapter 008 - 001 example</p>
	<p> It's like a bad version of Flappy Bird & uses Flappy Bird score board.  Check it out!</p>
        <h1>2025-02-23</h1>
	<p> There's a new code sample to try out.<br>
	And it almost feels like a game.  <br>
	Although it is the most difficult game you'll probably ever play.<br>
	Try out the sample from Chapter 007 - 003 to see what I mean.<br>
	You have to move the character's head right over the circle but when you do
        the circle will disappear & you will get 10 points.  There are 100 circles
        so see if you can get the max of 1,000 points to win.  It's terrible & difficult.  :)
